JumpTask is a recently launched project that is working to build up a worldwide work force network. This in an unofficial Discord bot interacting with JumpTask's API to provide you with information about JumpTask and their crypto token JumpToken hosted on the Smart Chain.

These are the commands:<br>
$price - will return an embed with the price of the JumpToken<br>
$info - will return an embed with information about JumpTask<br>
$roadmap - returns the JumpTask roadmap and plans for the future

There will be more commands coming in the future since I'm learning new things about the API every day. Stay tuned!
